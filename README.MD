# <a name="intro"></a>java-stix 

The Java bindings for STIX, the Structured Threat Information  eXpression 
language used for representing structured cyber threat information.

java-stix is being developed under the official [STIXProject][stix project]

For more information, see [http://stix.mitre.org/][stix].

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/STIXProject/java-stix.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/STIXProject/java-stix) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/STIXProject/java-stix.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/STIXProject/java-stix)

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

A primary goal of java-stix is to remain faithful to both the STIX 
specifications and customary Java practices. java-stix is designed to be 
intuitive both to Java developers and JAXB XML developers, provide convenience 
methods to the XJC generated JAXB model, but  obviously is not a one-for-one 
replacement for the [python-stix][python stix] API.

## <a name="versioning"></a>Versioning

Releases of java-stix will comply with the Semantic Versioning specification at 
[http://semver.org/][semver]. Java-stix is currently under active development; 
see TODO.txt for a tentative roadmap.  Releases will be announced on the [STIX 
discussion list][list].

## <a name="snapshots"></a>Snapshots

Snapshots are being pushed to 

https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mitre/stix/ 

So, users can simply retrieve java-stix directly via the Central Repository.

     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>snapshots-repo</id>
         <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
         <releases><enabled>false</enabled></releases>
         <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
	
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.mitre</groupId>
			<artifactId>stix</artifactId>
			<version>1.1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>

At a later date, release artifacts will appear in the Maven Central Repository.

# <a name="building"></a>Building

## <a name="cloning"></a>Clone the repository

Clone the java-stix project via:

	git clone https://github.com/STIXProject/java_stix.git

A `git clone` command will not retrieve schemas project automatically, but the 
Gradle build script will attempt to retrieve them on execution.

Alternatively, using the `--recursive` flag when cloning the repository will 
automatically initialize and update the schema submodules via:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/STIXProject/java_stix.git    

### <a name="gradle_wrapper"></a>Using the Gradle Wrapper

This project uses a Gradle build script.  The project comes with a Gradle 
Wrapper, a batch script on Windows, and a shell script for UNIX platforms 
including OS X thereby removing the need to have Gradle installed. 

For a UNIX platform, you can run Gradle from the project root via:

	./gradlew 

This documentation centers on UNIX-centric Gradle command-line execution  for 
brevity, but if you are on Windows you can run Gradle via:

	.\gradlew.bat
	

Executing the `tasks` Gradle task will inform you of all the tasks runnable 
from root project like so:

	./gradlew tasks
	
I'd advise using the Gradle command-line, but if you're using the Eclipse IDE 
consider installing the latest [Gradle IDE Pack][gradle ide pack].  Gradle 
Eclipse integration is somewhat emergent. or if you're using Netbeans consider 
using [Nodeclipse/Enide Gradle for Eclipse][nodeclipse].
 
## <a name="retrieving_schemas"></a>Retrieving the schemas

If the schemas are not present, the Gradle build script will attempt  to 
retreive and patch the schemas for you, but if it cannot for some reason you 
will need to retrieve them yourself.

Gradle will execute either the retrieve_schemas.sh shell script or the 
retreieve_schemas.bat batch script as appopriate for your platform.  You can 
find these in the root of the project, and try executing them yourself or you 
can follow the steps enumerated in the next section for retrieving the schemas.

Afterward, the cybOX schemas are patched for the flaw described in [cybOX 
Schema issue #340][issue 340].  Until the issue is resolved please be aware of 
the patch. The [patch][patch 340] is found at the root of the project.

## <a name="re_retrieving_schemas"></a>Re-retrieving the schemas

If you should need to re-retrieve the schemas have the Gradle build script do 
it for you:

	./gradlew cleanSchema

Then [build](#building_via_gradle) as normal.

### <a name="stix_schemas"></a>The STIX schemas

To manually retrieve the schemas, enter the project and run these additonal git 
commands on the command line:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update --force
	cd src/main/resources/schemas/v1.1.1
	git checkout tags/v1.1.1
    
Your not done.  You'll also need to retrieve the CybOX schemas.

### <a name="cybox_schemas"></a>The CybOX schemas

While in the project:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update --force
	git checkout 3442ebe50385d3bd0b3305952b90d296e0a1242c

When Gradle build script first runs it will also patch the CybOX schemas so 
that the JAXB2 Simple Document Object Model can be generated. Once patched, it 
will remained patched locally.  If Gradle fails to retrieve the schemas, you 
will need to patch the schemas by hand from the command-line.  The patch file, 
`cybox_object_archive_object_patch` is in  the root of the project.  NetBeans 
can also apply patches via
`Team` -> `Patches` -> `Apply Diff Patch`. 

## <a name="creating_document_object_model"></a>Creating the JAXB2 Document Object Model

### <a name="building_via_gradle"></a>Building

It is really unnecessary to build by hand, if your intention is to use the 
java-stix in your project as [snapshot](#importing_into_eclipse) exist in the 
Maven Central Snapshot repository, and soon releases will exist too. 

First change directories into the project and enter on the command-line:

	./gradlew

as `build` is the default Gradle task.

After the Gradle wrapper shell script has downloaded and cached the Gradle 
binary distribution, a successful build will look like something like this 
on UNIX:

	âžœ  java_stix git:(master) ./gradlew
	:buildSrc:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
	:buildSrc:compileGroovy

Ignore the javadoc tag warnings they have no impact on the build. Also, ignore 
the warning about unchecked or unsafe operations as they are an artifact of 
XJC being used to autogenerate the document object model.

If you want more detail about the build you can pass `--stacktrace --debug` on 
the command line like so:

	./gradlew --stacktrace --debug

for a more detailed build.  I set an environment `CI_OPTS` variable with this 
value for both Travis CI and CircleCi builds to be bettered informed as to why 
the buiid is failing. So if you want see this level of build detail, click on the
badges for either at the [top of this readme](#intro).

If the build goes well you will find the jars: 

	build/libs/stix-${version}.jar
	build/libs/stix-${version}-javadoc.jar 
	build/libs/stix-${version}.jar-sources.jar

where `${version}` is replaced with the `version` number in the Gradle build 
script.

### <a name="unit_testing"></a>Unit Testing

This project uses the [Spock Framework][spockframework] for unit testing. These 
tests are authored in [Groovy][groovylang] and exist under `src/test/groovy` 
path.

To execute the tests:

	./gradlew test

Consider using `-d`/`--debug` or `-i`/`--info` for more details during test 
execution like so:

	./gradlew test -i

The `test` task will generated a report that can be found at 
`build/reports/tests/index.html`.

## <a name="addendum"></a>Addendum

The author sees this section out of scope, but added it in hopes it will help 
you over a hurdle.

### <a name="building_on_windows"></a>Building On Windows

I don't frequently build on Windows so there is a chance the build may fail on 
this platform.  You will need additional dependencies normally found in UNIX, 
such as, GNU patch.  GNU Patch can be installed via either cygwin, Chocolatey, 
or directly.  Then you'll need to work out permission elevation  issues so 
Gradle can execute the command-line GNU patch command through Gradle's Ant 
integration.

To build on Windows use the gradlew batch script like so:

	$ .\gradlew.bat

If the build goes well you will find the jars: 

	build\libs\stix-${version}.jar
	build\libs\stix-${version}-javadoc.jar 
	build\libs\stix-${version}.jar-sources.jar

where `${version}` is replaced with the `version` number in the Gradle build 
script.  

### <a name="importing_into_eclipse"></a>Importing the project into Eclipse

As Eclipse's various Gradle plugins have varying degrees of usefulness, I 
usually import the project as a `Java Project` and not a `Gradle Project`.

You can still use `Gradle EnIDE` plugin to run the Gradle build script from the 
IDE, but you'll need to configure your `Gradle Home to use` 
via the Eclipse IDE preference panel.

After running the Gradle build script, if you are using the Eclipse IDE you may 
want to run the following from the command-line to set up the Ecipse 
environment:

	./gradlew build cleanEclipse eclipse

It entirely depends on how smart yoour Eclipse Gradle plugin is and how you 
imported the project.  The above command will change your prject to essentially 
a Java Project. If you run the command, then right-click on the Eclipse project 
and select "Refresh" to bring in the dependencies and source of JAXB Document 
Model. By default the generated source files are not editable to remmind you 
that changes to these files is usually a bad idea.

### <a name="opening_in_netbeans"></a>Opening the project into NetBeans

Like the [eclipse section above](#importing_into_eclipse), the author sees this 
section out of scope, but added it in hopes it will help you over the hurdle.

I've tested the project with NetBeans 8.0.1 and it works great with the [Gradle 
JavaEE Support plugin][netbeans gradle]. With the plugin installed, open the 
project and right-click on the project root and select `build` from the `task` 
panel.
